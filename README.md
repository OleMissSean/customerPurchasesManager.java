Programming Project #2 for CSci 112.

CSCI 112: Programming project 2

Due Date: July 9’th by 11:59 pm 

You will write a program to keep up with customer’s purchases. 

The customer has a name and credit card number.
Each purchase has a product description and an amount.
The order contains a date the purchase was made, a customer, and a list of purchases.
All the data is to be hard coded (Do Not ask the user for data) in the driver. The driver should not have any methods other than the main.

Your program will need to:
- be capable of creating an order for customers
- add purchases to the order
- modify (change) an order (i.e. a customers name, purchases description, purchases amount)
- display all the info about an order including an order total before and after modifications are made to an order.

To ensure your program works properly you will need at least 4 orders for different customers with at least 5 purchases per customer.

*No late programs will be accepted. If your program does not compile, it will not receive any credit. If you need help, come see me during my office hours, make an appointment with me, or speak to a TA in the labs on Sun – Thur from 5 – 8 pm.
